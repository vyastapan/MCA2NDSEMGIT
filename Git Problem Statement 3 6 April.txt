Here are the key points about the release branching strategy:

- Employed before software releases or deployments to production.
- Involves creating a separate release branch from the main development branch.
- Stabilizes code, performs final testing, and prepares for deployment in the release branch.
- Isolates release-related changes from ongoing development in the main branch.
- Allows for hotfixes to be applied directly to the release branch if critical issues are discovered.
- Facilitates activities like documentation updates, version number incrementation, and packaging for the release.
- Provides clear versioning by associating each release branch with a specific version of the software.
